        <!-- STORY GOES HERE -->
        <div class="article">
          <p>In March, Arami Walker took the stage to perform with a popular Argentinian band at a crowded Buenos Aires club. She spoke to the audience of locals in Spanish, a language she only learned a couple months before.</p>

          <p>Walker, a fifth-year world arts and cultures student, ran into the band in a bar earlier that night. Once band members learned Walker had singing experience, they invited her to perform their last song of the concert with them.</p>

          <p>For Walker, one of the five winners of the True Bruin Distinguished Senior Award, it was just another day in her time abroad and her history of performing.</p>

          <p>The True Bruin Distinguished Senior Award is given to students who have demonstrated excellence and service through leadership on and off campus, according to the scholarship's website. </p>

          <p>When she was younger, Walker and her friends would write and perform skits for their families, but Walker's parents urged her to become a lawyer because they felt her love for public speaking would be better suited to a practical field, she said.</p>

          <p>Walker spent part of her fourth year studying abroad in Argentina with a guitarist, who reinforced Walker's decision to devote her time at UCLA to performing arts. </p>

          <p>"He told me, 'If this is what you want to do, this is what you have to do every single day,'" Walker said. "'Stop wasting your time doing what people think you should be doing, and go for it with all of your heart.'"</p>

          <p>After returning to UCLA in spring, Walker began to create a bilingual poetry and song album, driven by her experiences in South America. </p>

          <p>"If I dedicate as much energy to music as I am now, by the time I&#8217;m 30, I'll know that what I leave behind on earth is representative of who I am as a person," said Walker. "If I die tomorrow, I want today to be filled with everything I love."</p>

          <p>Walker's close friend and UCLA alumnus Zakk Marquez said Walker's enthusiasm is clear in her powerful onstage presence.</p>

          <p>"If you've ever seen her perform, she is the sun," Marquez said.  "She demands attention."</p>

          <p>Walker has also performed with the UCLA Sex Squad, a group that aims to bring attention to sexual health through artistic expression at Los Angeles Unified School District high schools.</p>

          <p>As a fourth-year student, Walker performed a weekly piece that focused on how hip-hop music affected her perception of self-worth. </p>

          <p>"All of our lives ... we&#8217;re singing songs about our own bodies," Walker said. "What we don&#8217;t realize is that we&#8217;re chanting mantras of how our bodies aren&#8217;t worth any more (than) their physical shell." </p>

          <p>She said students approached her after the shows to tell her they really connected with her message. </p>

          <p>"I had a 15-year-old girl come up to me and tell me that I changed her life," Walker said. "She wanted to start writing poetry, and ... start paying attention (to the lyrics in songs)." </p>

          <p>Walker's boyfriend, fifth-year anthropology student Drew Frye, said he thinks Walker's ability to connect with her audience is valuable when she is discussing health and identity with high schoolers.</p>

          <p>"She&#8217;s used that presence to connect with the hearts and minds of thousands of high schoolers, to push them to see past who media tells them they should be, and be who they really are," Frye said.</p>

          <p> Walker said her family was always supportive of her decision to join the group, but she truly felt the impact of her performances when she saw her conservative grandmother approach Walker's gay best friend and commend him for his performance.</p>

          <p>"I actually saw in my own family a change in perception about queer people, which was really awesome for me," Walker said.</p>

          <p>Walker said she aims to create dialogue through her poetry, which focuses on the common human experience. </p>

          <p>Her first poem, which she wrote when she was a first-year, addressed how people use the word "n-----". Walker said  she thought her own experience of growing up in a biracial household gave her a unique perspective on the often-controversial issue she addresses.</p>

          <p>"My mom has blue eyes and straight hair, and I have brown eyes and brown skin," Walker said. "Looking into my mom&#8217;s eyes and seeing how much she loved me every day, I never really  understood racism until I got to college."</p>

          <p>She performed the poem at an event held by an African-American fraternity, in front of her parents and grandparents. Walker said the pride she saw in their faces encouraged her to pursue poetry. </p>

          <p>Peter Sellars, one of Walker's world arts and cultures professors, said her dedication to bringing new perspectives to others has helped her in her projects both inside and outside his class.</p>

          <p>During her time in Sellars' class, which focused on the Black Lives Matter movement, Walker incorporated poetry and images into a piece she performed in front of 400 students.</p>

          <p>"The kind of power and commitment (she has) is really special," Sellars said. "She's going to do anything she wants to (in the future), and the world is going to watch."</p>

          <p>Walker said she plans to continue exploring her passions for health education and performance art in the future, and foresees a career that allows her to have a voice in social issues. </p>

          <p>"I definitely aim to be a world leader," Walker said. "I plan to have my voice heard across nations, whatever that may take."</p>

         <p>  In 2017, Michael Anderson will watch the UCLA Mission Operations Center launch his satellite into space.</p>
         
         <p> Anderson, a fourth-year applied mathematics student, was the chief engineer for the Electron Losses and Fields Investigation CubeSat, or ELFIN, the first satellite built by UCLA students. The satellite, about the size of a loaf of bread, will collect data on how electrons in Earth's radiation belts are scattered by different electromagnetic waves.</p>

         <p> "It was kind of crazy to think in a couple of years I’m going to be putting something into space," Anderson said.</p>

         <p> Anderson recently won the True Bruin Distinguished Senior Award scholarship, which is given to five seniors who demonstrate leadership in service and academia, according to the award's website.</p>

         <p> Lydia Bingley, project leader for ELFIN and a graduate student in geophysics and space physics, said ELFIN team members consider Anderson one of the founders of the project, and credit him for helping turn the idea into a reality.</p>

         <p> As a first year, Anderson noticed a lot of renewed activity in the commercial space sector, which made him consider focusing his studies on aerospace engineering.</p>

         <p> “I was watching a live-streamed spacewalk on my phone, and I thought it might be a good time to switch over to a south campus major," Anderson said. “I was hesitant to switch ... but when I did, I never looked back.”</p>

         <p> As a second year, Anderson joined the UCLA Rocket Project, which cemented his decision to pursue aerospace sciences.</p>

         <p> "The first day I showed up at the lab, I was making carbon fiber parts for the rocket body," Anderson said. "I thought, 'This is what I want to do for the next three years.'"</p>

         <p> Anderson said he had a difficult time fitting in at UCLA until he joined the Rocket Project.</p>

         <p> “That was when I first felt like I had a family on campus, and a community I connected with,” Anderson said. “I loved building rockets, and the people I was working with became my best friends.”</p>

         <p> Alan Anderson, Michael's father, said Michael was always focused on academics but never considered his interest in space as anything more than a hobby.</p>

         <p> “He has always had an affinity for space,” Alan Anderson said. “The idea was always there, but it wasn’t until he got to UCLA that it could really thrive.”</p>

         <p> After joining the Rocket Project, Anderson learned about the ELFIN project, which was nothing more than a concept at the time. Faculty members had repeatedly proposed the project since 2009, but there was no funding to get the project off the ground, Anderson said.</p>

         <p> By 2013, Anderson and a group of fellow students had taken over the ELFIN project, developing plans for the satellite and hoping they would raise enough money to build it. In 2014, the NASA and the National Science Foundation awarded the ELFIN project a $1.2 million grant.</p>

         <p> “When you look at space, there’s so much stuff we haven’t even begun to explore yet,” Anderson said. "I wanted to be a part of those missions, out on the edge of pure exploration."</p>

         <p> At the end of his second year, Anderson traveled with Bingley and the ELFIN team to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to present the project to an Air Force review board. Bingley said their project manager, who planned to give the presentation, fell ill the day before.</p>

         <p> "We were desperate and terrified, but Michael and I stayed up all night and prepared in eight hours for a presentation other students finished in two months," Bingley said. "It was an incredible experience, lifting each other up and supporting each other like that."</p>

         <p> Anderson said his work on ELFIN led him to an eight-month aerospace engineering internship at Planetary Resources, Inc., where he worked on a spacecraft called the Arkyd 3. The spacecraft, named after a droid from Star Wars, exploded 15 seconds after its initial launch, Anderson said.</p>

         <p> "I saw it go up in flames (while I watched) the live stream from the ELFIN lab," Anderson said. "But luckily, we made multiple copies of everything."</p>

         <p> Last July, the Arkyd 3 Reflight was successfully deployed from the International Space Station. Scott Kelly, an astronaut aboard the International Space Station, took photos of the spacecraft and sent them to the company's team.</p>

         <p> "It’s really cool to see something you’ve worked on in space, with Earth in the background," Anderson said.</p>

         <p> Anderson, now in his last quarter at UCLA, has applied to six graduate schools with aerospace engineering programs.</p>

         <p> “He’s going to get to do some things he’s always dreamed about,” Alan Anderson said. “For a lot of kids those are just dreams, but Michael’s going to make those dreams reality.”</p>

         <p> Anderson is currently working as an intern with The Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit organization that provides technical advice and assessments to space missions. He said he uses his experience engineering ELFIN to develop satellite performance simulations.</p>

         <p> Bingley said she thinks Anderson will be a leader, whether he ends up at a small company or a big one.</p>

         <p> “He’s going to be inspiring a younger crowd, educating them and building them up,” Bingley said.</p>
